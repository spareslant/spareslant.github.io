      <description>Introduction: We will be creating a simple SaltStack execution module. And will see how can this module be called
 from a state file from command line  Pre-Requisites  salt-master installed and configured on a machine. I used fedora-24 VM. salt-minion installed and configured to accept command from salt-master.  /etc/salt/master file used:
log_level: debug fileserver_backend: - roots file_roots: base: - /srv/salt /etc/salt/minion file used:
master: salt Note: In /etc/salt/master file, log_level is set to debug.</description>

      <description>Introduction: Sometimes a minion may need to execute something which is central to whole system. e.g. Minion may need to update an external common Database whose write access is given only to master. Therefore minion may need to ask salt-master to execute on its behalf. This can be done by
 Minion calling runner on salt-master runner executing a custom execution module that provides access to DB  As a custom execution module needs to be executed on salt-master, therefore salt-minion also needs to be installed on salt-master.</description>
